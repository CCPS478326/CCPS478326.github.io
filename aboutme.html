    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p> I am working towards building a successful business and company that will make me a ton of money for not just me, But my family such as my parents siblings, and then hopefully and eventually for my kids. The experiences that led me to my goals and positions were my family being successful and me wanting to live up to my last name and prove all of my doubters wrong.
 I am constantly speaking with my dad and grandpa who are both successful and know everything about how to start a business and make a successful and profitable business. Eventually I plan to get a job to be able to fund whatever business idea/company I decide to start.
 I think all I need for my success is to just not let all the haters and noise get in my head and try and bring me down. But also take advice from people that want me to succeed and have succeeded in life. But for me most importantly is yo just have faith in god and trust he leads me in the right direction.
 My short term goals are to, Get a business idea, Get a business license, Start going door to door and marketing/selling my brand.
 My hard work determination and my ability to prove myself right and everybody else wrong that I will be successful in my future. I just wanna be known as a good honest man that gave his family a good life because of my sacrifice and just be able to buy my kids or wife anything they want.
